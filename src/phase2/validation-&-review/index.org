* Introduction
  This document details phase 2 validation and review process for the
  outreach intership program. This process would be followed after the
  interns start resolving the issues for the IIIT H labs. Based on the
  fix, it would be reviewed by the VLEAD team and accepted/rejected.

* Motivation
  This internship program is conducted to motivate students
  from the Nodal center colleges to contribute towards this
  mission mode project run by MHRD. Students would be
  contributing towards the open source development community
  as well as improve the Virtual Labs. The motivation for us
  behind conducting such internship program is to do
  outreach activities for the Virtual Labs and improve its
  reach to as many colleges as possible.

* Process
** Phase 2 - Validation and Review (Selected interns)
   [[./docs/phase2-validation.org][Link for the document]]

* Logistics
** Prize Money
   Based on the issues resolved and the total points attained (S1:5,
   S2:3, S3:1), we can have a leaderboard depicting all the interns
   rankwise and award cash prizes/vouchers to the top 3 interns every
   week or so. At the end of the program, every intern would at least
   earn a certificate and others who performed well would also earn
   cash prizes along with the certificates.

* Fallback plans
** A. Calling up MSIT students
   In case we do not the expected response from the college students
   or they do not raise issues which are valid enough for the next
   phase of the program or they are not capable to resolve the issues
   raised, we would try and call MSIT students housed at IIITH itself
   and provide the same perks and advantages to make this program a
   success.
** B. Calling up IIITH students
   In case Plan A also doesn's work out due to unforeseen constraints,
   we would connect with IIITH students itself for this internship
   activity.

* Conclusion
  The labs would be improved as part of this program giving us an edge
  in outreach programs by connecting to the different Nodal
  Coordinators across the state.
