* Introduction
  This document describes the process to be followed by the selected
  interns/interested students who wish to contribute to the open
  source community for resolving the issues raised by them.

* Link for lab code repositories
  Please use this [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/][link]] for the IIIT-Hyderabad lab code repositories
  for the raised issues as part of the Virtual Labs Bugathon 2018. The
  IIIT hyderabad labs which needs to be fixed would have a naming
  convention of <labname>-iiith. Please go through all the repos
  existing here and pick the ones for which you have raised
  issues. 

  All the issues after review and found valid are migrated in these
  repos from your personal GitLab accounts. You are free to pick
  up any issues whether they are raised by you or by any other
  student. We are not assigning any issue to anybody.
* Status of issues
  At any given time an issue should only be in one of the below
  described states. Since issues cannot be assigned labels by students(as they don't have access to virtual-labs organisation),
  any of these labels can be given as a comment under the issue. 

  - *Open* : This indicates that when an issue is
    logged and posted for the first time, it would be
    labelled as 'Open'.

  - *In Progress* : This indicates that Open issues
    while being worked upon by the student/intern would be
    labelled as 'In Progress'.

  - *Fixed* : This indicates that the issue has been fixed by the
    student in their forked GitHub repository. Only the students can
    mark the issue as fixed. Validators would only validate fixed
    issues.

  - *Resolved* : This indicates that when validators reviews the
    fixes then they can label the issue as Resolved. Only the
    validators can mark the issue as Resolved.

  - *Reopen* : This indicates that if an issue surfaces during
    testing in the staging and production environments, the Virtual
    Labs team would label it as 'Reopen'.

  - *Closed* : This label indicates that Resolved issues would be
    labelled as 'Closed' by the Virtual Labs team members after they
    pass the deployment tests. This label means that the issue is
    resolved, tested and approved and is ready to go for production
    deployment.

* Steps to be followed by the interns
  + Step 1 - Choose a lab for which you want to start resolving the
    issues. Select the lab repository from [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/][GitHub]].
  + Step 2 - Fork the lab repository so that you have the local copy
    of the lab codebase in your machine.
  + Step 3 - Go to the issues section in the repo and pick up the
    issue you want to start resolving. Label the issue as *open*.
  + Step 4 - Make changes in your forked copy of the lab repo, [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HlGjkacVdE7-3FRc8x8RKEUJiTmfnrxqe8BX4ZjnSNI/edit?usp=sharing][commit]]
    the changes and create a pull request.
  + Step 5 - After you create the pull request, update the same issue
    with *commit id* of the code changes for which you created a pull
    request. Comment on the issue as *fixed*.
  + Step 6 - Once the issue has comment as *fixed* , provide the issue
    link on Slack channel for 2 members to validate the fix. One
    member could be from the same college but the other validator must
    be from some other college. Both the validators must also review
    the fixes and respond on the same issue with the comment that the
    issue fix is correct.
  + Step 7 - Once the issue gets reviewed and approved by the 2
    validators, the Virtual Labs team would review the fix for the
    final acceptance. If the issue fix is accepted by the Virtual Labs
    team also, it would be labelled as *resolved*.
  + Step 8 - After you see the issue labelled as *resolved* and more
    than one student was working on the issue simultaneously, consider
    that the issue is fixed no more fixes would be accepted by any
    other student.
  + Step 9 - Switch to some other issue when you see an issue labelled
    as *resolved*. It would still not be marked as *closed* because it
    would be undergoing the deployment testing by the Virtual Labs
    team.

    This is an iterative cycle and it goes on till the end of the
    marked period for all the selected students. This marked period is
    till 15th July 2018 for now.

    Interns have to report to Virtual Labs team once in a week i.e. on
    every Friday between 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for review process and
    other guidance.
* Conclusion
  After the validation process, the issues would be considered as
  resolved and moved to production. Based on the first fix provided by
  the student, they would be ranked every week. At the end of 5 weeks,
  we should be able to close the issues which have been moved to
  production and that would mark the end of the internship for the
  selected candidates.
