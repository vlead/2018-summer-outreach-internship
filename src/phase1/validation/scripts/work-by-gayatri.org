Issue migration from gitlab to Github.

  Started the process by searching for API’s on the web for direct migration of issues along with tags and labels.
  Found two API’s but they needed a local instance of gitlab hosted on one of our servers.
  This would not be possible with the repositories of the
    students applying for the internship.
  The other way was to download all the issues into a csv
    file and then upload the file on Github.
  Found an add-on for google sheets which automatically
    downloads all issues in the given repository into the
    file. This file can be downloaded in csv format.
  The saved csv file can now be uploaded to github with a
    script available.
  The script and directions for using the add-on are on this
    link:

Validation and review

  All the issues are already available in the csv file
    downloaded in the above step.
  Wrote a bash script for the segregation of issues based
    on lab_name, exp_name and then finally based on the
    subsection of the experiment where the bug is found.
  When this script is run the issues belonging to the same
    subsection of the same experiment of the same lab are put
    into one bucket.
  The script first creates a lab-bucket with all the labs as
    directories and the issues related to each lab in their
    respective directory. This is done recursively for
    experiments and sub-sections in the experiments as well.
  This can now be easily transferred to the respective
    lab-repos on github using the script mentioned above.
