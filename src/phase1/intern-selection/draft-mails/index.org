* Introduction
  This document contains all the draft mails which are sent to the
  students as well as Nodal Coordinators for the outreach intership
  program. These mails keep up the enthusiasm amongst the potential
  participants and also give us the idea on the progress of the
  internship program.

* Motivation
  This internship program is conducted to motivate students
  from the Nodal center colleges to contribute towards this
  mission mode project run by MHRD. Students would be
  contributing towards the open source development community
  as well as improve the Virtual Labs. The motivation for us
  behind conducting such internship program is to do
  outreach activities for the Virtual Labs and improve its
  reach to as many colleges as possible.

* Fallback plans
** A. Calling up MSIT students
   In case we do not the expected response from the college students
   or they do not raise issues which are valid enough for the next
   phase of the program or they are not capable to resolve the issues
   raised, we would try and call MSIT students housed at IIITH itself
   and provide the same perks and advantages to make this program a
   success.
** B. Calling up IIITH students
   In case Plan A also doesn's work out due to unforeseen constraints,
   we would connect with IIITH students itself for this internship
   activity.

* Conclusion
  Based on the issues raised the students would be given an
  opportunity to work as an intern in virtual labs and also contribute
  in a mission mode MHRD project. The labs would be improved as part
  of this program giving us an edge in outreach programs by connecting
  to the different Nodal Coordinators across the state.
